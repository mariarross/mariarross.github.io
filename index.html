	<h1>The Incomplete and Messy Webpage of Maria Ross</h1>
	<p> My name is Maria Ross, I am a MSc student in  mathematics at the University of  Glasgow. I got my  BSc in mathematics from the University  of Puget  Sound  in  Tacoma, Washington in 2019. My advisor for my undergraduate degree was the fantastic <a href="/CV.pdf">Professor Rob Beezer</a>. </p>
	<p> My research  interests are distributed through various areas of pure mathematics. I have the most  research experience in analytic and algebraic number theory, and these  areas are at  the  top  of my  list of  interests. I also am interested in all things algebraic, and I am particularly fond of group theory, Galois theory, and representation theory. I also like  combinatorics and graph theory, although I prefer using  these to  study algebraic structures (my  undergraduatet thesis was in geometric group theory.)</p>
