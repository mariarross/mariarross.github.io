	<h1>The Incomplete and Messy Webpage of Maria Ross</h1>
	<p> My name is Maria Ross, I am a MSc student in  mathematics at the University of  Glasgow. I got my  BSc in mathematics from the University  of Puget  Sound  in  Tacoma, Washington in 2019. My advisor for my undergraduate degree was the fantastic <a href="http://buzzard.ups.edu/", target="_blank">Professor Rob Beezer</a>. </p>
	<p> My research  interests are distributed through various areas of pure mathematics. I have the most  research experience in analytic and algebraic number theory, and these  areas are at  the  top  of my  list of  interests. I also am interested in all things algebraic, and I am particularly fond of group theory, Galois theory, and representation theory. I also like  combinatorics and graph theory, although I prefer using  these to  study algebraic structures (my  undergraduate thesis was in geometric group theory.)</p>

	<p> Publications: </p>
	<ul> <li>  <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~masri/Torsion-6-22-18.pdf", target="_blank">Nonvanishing of Hecke L-functions and Bloch Kato p-Selmer Groups</a>, with Arianna Iannuzzi, Byoung Du Kim, Riad Masri, Alex Mathers, and Wei-Lun Tsai. Mathematical Research Letters, Volume 26  </li>  </ul>
	<p> Course notes: </p>
	<li> (I  will insert course notes from my master's degree courses once they  are complete enough to be  viewed publicly) </li>
	<p> Talks:
	<ul> <li> Distribution of Primes and the L-functions Ratios Conjecture,  with Casimir Kothari, from Young Mathematician's Conference at Ohio State University in 2018 </li>
	<li> L-functiions  etc </li>
	</ul> </p>
	
	<p> Toy papers (that is, papers I had to write for undergraduate classes which are not particularly good or enlightening, and probably havem any typographical  errors, but may be useful or  interesting to very particular audiences  (specified with each paper): </p>
	<ul> <li> <a href="/Analysis (6).pdf", target="_blank">Introduction to Operator Algebras</a> (2019) This is an introduction to the theory of  operator algebras aimed at an audience with only some real analysis (i.e., no functional analysis or  particular amount of  algebra is  necessary.) This was written as a final project for undergraduate real analysis </li>
	<li> <a href="/MST.pdf", target="_blank">Minimum Spanning Trees</a> (2019)This is just a description of  the Minimum Spanning Tree problem for graphs. This paper was written as  a final  project for a mathematical optimization  course so is intended for an  audience with some  knowledge of mathematical optimization but no other mathematical background </li>
	<li> Modules- (2017) This is my final project from my undergraduate abstract algebra class,  so it is  aimed at an audience with knowledge of introductory abstract algebra (i.e.  basic group and ring  theory) but  no further algebraic concepts </li> </ul>
