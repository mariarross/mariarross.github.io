	<p> I received my MSc in mathematics from the University in Glasgow in 2020. My thesis, advised by Dr. Efthymios Sofos, was titled "Siegel Zeros and the Twin Prime Conjecture". I received my BSc in mathematics from the University of Puget Sound in 2019. My thesis, advised by Professor Rob Beezer, was titled "Implications of Cayley Graph Isomoorphisms on Underlying Groups". </p>
